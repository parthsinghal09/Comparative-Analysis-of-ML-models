# Comparitive-Analysis-of-ML-models

Comparitive study and analysis of various ML models including Fisher Linear Discriminant, Linear Perceptron, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. Sklearn Library was used for the implementation of the models and the training and testing of the data was done using 7 fold cross validation technique. Test set accuracy over each fold has been presented using a box-plot.
